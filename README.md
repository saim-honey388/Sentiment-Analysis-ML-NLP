# Sentiment-Analysis-ML-NLP
Sentiment analysis using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and ensemble learning with text preprocessing techniques using NLP and TF-IDF Vectorizer.
# Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning and NLP

This project applies machine learning models to classify text as either positive or negative using sentiment analysis. The models include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, combined in an ensemble learning approach.

## Project Overview
- Text preprocessing using NLP techniques such as stopword removal, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization.
- Model training using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Soft-voting ensemble classifier for improved accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Joblib
- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Voting Classifier
- **Text Processing:** TfidfVectorizer, Lemmatization, Stopwords removal
